## Paragraph about what I find interesting about the article
Video Streaming service like Netflix has become so seamless and easy to use that few of us would bother to think what really happends behind the software. 
Netflix used to build their own datacenters but eventually decide to migrate to AWS for reliability and focus their time on the core service.
This article talks about how Netflix is able to scale and deliver their service to its clients.

What I find so fascinating about this article is that Netflix was able to make itself a largescale service in two aspects. First, it took 
advantage of the Cloud, migrating to AWS to cater to the large number of users as well as the huge amounts of content Netflix has to offer. 
In addition, Netflix spent time on the client aspect, creating a seamless and minimalistic experience to ensure that the user is able to get 
what he/she wants from the service.
