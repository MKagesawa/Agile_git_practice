## An article I find interesting
[Netflix: What Happens When You Press Play?](http://highscalability.com/blog/2017/12/11/netflix-what-happens-when-you-press-play.html)

## Paragraph about what I find interesting about the article
Video Streaming service like Netflix has become so seamless and easy to use that few of us would bother to think what really happends behind the software.
Netflix used to build their own datacenters but eventually decide to migrate to AWS for reliability and focus their time on the core service.
This article talks about how Netflix is able to scale and deliver their service to its clients.

What I find so fascinating about this article is that Netflix was able to make itself a largescale service in two aspects. First, it took 
advantage of the Cloud, migrating to AWS to cater to the large number of users as well as the huge amounts of content Netflix has to offer. 
In addition, Netflix spent time on the client aspect, creating a seamless and minimalistic experience to ensure that the user is able to get 
what he/she wants from the service.

I find it very interesting how Netflix uses CDN to deliver its content to its clients quickly and cheaply. This article got me more intereted in scalability of tech companies which is not a topic usually covered in CS classes. Netflix is now a daily part of so many people's lives, yet I never thought about how hard it is to realistically produce this product on the larger scale.

What I like about this article is that it illustrates Netflix's structure so well in an easy-understand way. Also, I am surprised by Netflix's bold decision adopting AWS a decade ago and how dedicated it is trying to create a seamless service to its clients. This is overall a great article by which I gain much deeper understanding of Netflix.
